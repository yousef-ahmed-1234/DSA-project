# 📝 Spell Checker (C++)

## 📌 Overview  
The **Spell Checker** is a C++ program that checks the spelling of words in a given text file by comparing them against a predefined dictionary. It demonstrates core C++ programming concepts such as file handling, data structures, string manipulation, and algorithmic logic.  
This project highlights how basic text-processing utilities can be implemented from scratch using fundamental C++ techniques.
